# Python Generators & SQL Streaming

## About the Project

This project introduces advanced usage of **Python generators** to efficiently handle large datasets, process data in batches, and simulate real-world scenarios involving live updates and memory-efficient computations.

The tasks focus on leveraging Python‚Äôs `yield` keyword to implement generators that provide **iterative access** to data, promoting optimal resource utilization and improving performance in data-driven applications.
